## About Me

I am a Computer Science Masters student at Stanford University, where I'm pursuing an MSCS with a specialization in Visual Computing, which sits at the intersection of AI/ML, graphics, and systems. My interests lie specifically in Computer Graphics and Geometric Computing, and in developing tools to empower creativity.

## Updates

- **[June 2024]** Started my summer internship as a Computer Graphics Engineer @ Sileom.
- **[June 2024]** Finished Year 1 of my MSCS! Check out what I worked on [_below_](www.google.com).
- **[Sept 2023]** Began MSCS Program at Stanford University. Plan to graduate in June 2025.
- **[May 2023]** Graduated from Georgetown University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
