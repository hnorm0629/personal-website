## About Me

I am a Computer Science Masters student at Stanford University, where I'm pursuing an MSCS with a specialization in Visual Computing, which sits at the intersection of AI/ML, graphics, and systems. My interests lie specifically in Computer Graphics and Geometric Computing, and in developing tools to empower creativity.
